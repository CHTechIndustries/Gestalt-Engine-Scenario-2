        	<description>The Bio-Stable Genes where designed to make a specific stat higher, at the cost of preventing it from going past a specific amount. /n/ The 30% adds 100% to any stat, conteracting many issues. However, it also prevents said stat from passing 30% \n\ . This one stabilizes conscisness, allowing them to survive major brain injuries</description>

However, it also prevents said stat from passing 30% \n\. This one stabilizes noireceptors, causing major pain, but preventing anything from causing more pain! That also means that "+30 Percent" is actually "30 under 100 percent"</description>
