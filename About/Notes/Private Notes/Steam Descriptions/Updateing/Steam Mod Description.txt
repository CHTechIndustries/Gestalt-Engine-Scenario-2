[*]Bleeding Eyes for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907470506]RoM Genes[/url]. It's ported in [i]almost[/i] one-for-one
[*]Touch-nir for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3023584656]All Rimworld of Magic Class Genes[/url], which I used as a basis for my class genes (although mine are soft requriments)
