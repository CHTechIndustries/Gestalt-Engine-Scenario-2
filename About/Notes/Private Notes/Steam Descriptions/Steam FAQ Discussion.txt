[*]Q: Is this Combat Extended compatible?
A: Uh... sure. There might be "unintented features" (especially as more code is added) that we can't guarentee to fix, but you do you and all!
[*]Q: Why does this mod need both biotech and royalty?
A: Simple. Many of the features are so interwoven between the too, that removing one is outright impossible!
[*]Q:Why does this mod need Expanded Biotech Style Genes Framework and Big and Small+ Prerequisites Framework?
A: Well, that is because this mod utilizes features from those frameworks, and thus requires them!
[*]Q: Alright, fair enough. But, why does it need Alpha Genes?
A: Well, Alpha Genes also has lots of useful code, so it's almost a framework in and of itself!
[*]Q: So, is that why Expanded Biotech Style Genes, Expanded Archite Genes, More Biotech Genes, and Super Hero Genes- Base is required?
A:Well, yes and no. Yes, that is why Super Hero Genes- Base is required. No, because those other 3 are just mods that use those 3, and are thus great for gene requirments and examples for balancing.
[*]Q: Okay, that answers all requirment questions. Why, though, is it incompatible with all the other "Expanded ..." and "Biotech Style ... "?
A: Well, the all in 1 has all those features, and subscribing to both those is redundent. Also, it could cause minor issues, so just use the better one!
[*]Q: Why is this mod called Rimworld Genes Extended, not Rimworld Biotech Extended
A: That is because I have a plan for a mod called Rimworld Biotech Extended. It involes genetic synthesyze, cloning, growth vat improvments, and more!
[*]Q: With all these mods, did you bite off more than you can chew?
A: Uh... I do have the right to remain silent, right?
