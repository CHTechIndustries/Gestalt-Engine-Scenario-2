Rimworld Genes Extended is a mod that enhances Expanded Biotech Style Genes, extents on other mods genes, and makes new genes.

Do note, however, that this mod mostly adds single-mod affecting/ simpler multi-mod genes. More advanced genes [i]and[/i] new mechanics will be in addons. In other words, this mod series (still working on finalizing a name for it. Once that happens, the title might change) has a few "teirs"

[*]Rimworld Genes Integrated
	This mod will make new genes requiring multiple mods. For instance, integration between 2 specific mods, as optional dependencies won't allow them. Examples include:[olist]

For a mod that adds in xenos based off [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114130835]Rimworld Genes Extended[/url] (and it's dependencies), look at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3097961901]Xenotypes Expanded and Merged[/url], , the first mod to use this as a requirment! It is not as high a priority update-wise, but it shall still be updated to utilize new features from any and all these mods, as well as many others!

[b]NOTE: THE ICONS IN THIS MOD ARE [i]PLACEHOLDERS[/i], UNTILL I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE "GOOD" ICONS, AND HAVE TIME TO DO THAT[/b]
