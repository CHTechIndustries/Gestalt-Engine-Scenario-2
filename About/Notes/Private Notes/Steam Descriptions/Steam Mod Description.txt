Rimworld Genes Extended is a mod that enhances Expanded Biotech Style Genes, extents on other mods genes, and makes new genes.

Do note, however, that this mod contains primarily basic interactions. More advanced things, like genes for Save our Ship integration, will be seperate mods as there will be many more modules to that.

Currently, some of the features that are in the works include: [olist]
[*]More features for Super Hero Genes (by alite)
[*]genes for the mod "Godly Trait Genes".

For a mod that adds in xenos based off [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114130835]Rimworld Genes Extended[/url] (and it's dependencies), look at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3097961901]Xenotypes Expanded and Merged[/url], the first mod to use this as a requirment! It is not as high a priority update-wise, but it shall still be updated to utilize new features from any and all these mods, as well as many others!
